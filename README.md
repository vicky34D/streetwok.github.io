# StreetWok — Anti-Gravity Experience
A small demo website that combines a biker-café design with a playful anti-gravity effect using Matter.js.

## What you get
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles and theming
- `app.js` — physics and interactivity (uses Matter.js)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run
1. Unzip the project and open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. For best results allow loading external scripts (Matter.js is loaded from CDN).
3. Use the controls in the header: Gravity, Nitro, Mode, Reset. Type a query into the search box and press Enter to search.

## Notes
- This is a lightweight front-end demo — no back-end needed.
- You can customize the logo, icons, and sounds easily by editing the DOM elements in `index.html`.
